Overview
========

`sva` is a Rust implementation of Spatial Vector Algebra based on [nalgebra](https://github.com/rustsim/nalgebra).

This implementation is heavily based on the [SpaceVecAlg](https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/SpaceVecAlg) C++ library.

Disclaimer
==========
This is a work in progress so a full implementation is not yet available. Once all the code is written and the tests passes, I will upload this crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io).
